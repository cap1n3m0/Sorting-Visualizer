# Sorting_Visualizer

Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science, essential for optimizing the performance of various applications. However, understanding the step-by-step process of different sorting algorithms can be challenging.The Sorting Visualizer can assists individuals in grasping sorting algorithms by visually representing them.

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that provides a dynamic and engaging way to learn and understand various sorting algorithms. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to visualize how different sorting techniques organize data in real-time. By offering a graphical representation of algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, the Sorting Visualizer makes the learning process intuitive and enjoyable.

### Features:

1. Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a range of popular sorting algorithms to visualize.
2. Speed Adjustment: Control the speed of the visualization to see the algorithms in slow motion or fast-forward.
3. Customizable Input: Enter custom arrays or use randomly generated arrays of varying sizes.
4. Real-Time Visualization: Watch the sorting process unfold step by step with animated transitions.
5. Algorithm Insights: Provide detailed analysis and performance metrics such as time complexity and space complexity.
6. Educational Annotations: Display key steps and explanations of what is happening during each stage of the sorting process.

### Important Node:
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
    1. Blue:default
    2. Yellow: Being compared
    3. Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
    4. Green: In correct position
2) Controls for visualizations
      1. Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
      2. Data size ()
      3. Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).

### Algorithms Covered:

1. Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. Selection Sort: An in-place comparison sort that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part.
3. Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with each new item being inserted into the correct position.
4. Quick Sort: An efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the array into sub-arrays which are then recursively sorted.
5. Merge Sort: A stable, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.


### User Interface:

### Potential Enhancements:

1. Additional Algorithms: Expand the library to include other sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.
2. Comparative Analysis: Allow users to visualize two algorithms side-by-side to compare their performance on the same dataset.
3. User Feedback: Collect user feedback to continuously improve the visualizer and add requested features.
